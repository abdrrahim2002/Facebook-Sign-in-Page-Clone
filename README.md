# Facebook Sign-in Page Clone

This project is a clone of the **Facebook Sign-in Page**, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It mimics the structure and design of the real **Facebook** login page as a practice project.

## About the Project
This project was created as part of my early web development learning journey. It helped me practice structuring HTML elements and styling with CSS to create a visually accurate clone of Facebook's login page.
